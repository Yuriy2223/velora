          Working alongside fast-scaling international companies, we kept seeing
          the same pattern: Ambition was strong. Markets were open. Funding was
          secured.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          But growth stalled — not because of strategy, but because of people
          and systems misalignment.

          We didn't start as recruiters. We started as problem-solvers inside
          scaling environments. Velora began as a strategic recruitment partner
          and quickly evolved into something broader: Company that designs human
          infrastructure

          Today, we integrate executive hiring, structural design, and internal
          systems thinking into one cohesive approach.
